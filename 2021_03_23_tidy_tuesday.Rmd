# Load the weekly Data

Dowload the weekly data and make available in the `tt` object.

```{r Load}
tt <- tt_load("2021-03-23")

```
```{r mutate}
unvotes <- tt$unvotes %>% 
  mutate(vote_number = match(vote, c("no","abstain","yes")) -2)

unvotes %>% 
    count(country, sort = TRUE)
unvotes %>% 
    count(vote, vote_number)
```
```{r votes}
by_country <- unvotes %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(n_votes =n(),
           n_yes = sum(vote == "yes"),
           pct_yes = n_yes / n_votes) %>% 
  filter(n_votes >= 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_yes)) 

by_country %>% 
  tail(20) %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, pct_yes)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pct_yes, country)) +
